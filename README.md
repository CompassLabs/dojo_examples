# Dojo Examples

This repository contains code examples for [dojo](https://www.compasslabs.ai#dojo)

In order to run these, you must have Dojo installed on your machine with a valid license key.

Please refer to the [**_Getting Started_**](https://www.compasslabs.ai/docs/getting-started) guide in the docs for more detailed instructions on getting setup 🙂

## ⬇️ Installation

You'll need to clone this repository directly. For example, if you have SSH authentication, you can run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CompassLabs/dojo_examples.git
```

Then, install dojo via pip

```bash
pip install dojo-compass
```

Finally, [install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) on your system

## 📄 Authentication

Dojo requires two configurations to run:
1. A valid License Key
2. An archive node URL (available from providers like Infura)

Set these as environment variables by following our guide [here](https://www.compasslabs.ai/docs/getting-started#3-setup-configuration).

## 😧 If something isn't working...

We're a small team and Dojo is a very early stage software. If something isn't working as expected, do [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/CompassLabs/dojo_examples/issues) and we'll do our best to fix whatever is wrong.
